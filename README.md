# Number Translator

![image](http://www.instantdisplay.co.uk/numberban.jpg)

This is one of my first big Ruby projects. Here's what Number Translator does:

It takes any given number, from 0 to 999 trillion, and translates it into its respective words. 
For example, 245 will return "two hundred forty five". Shiny, eh? Hope you like it!
