# Number Translator

This is one of my first big Ruby projects. Here's what Number Translator does:

It takes (nearly) any given number, from 0 to 999 trillion, and translates it into its respective words. 
For example, 245 will return "two hundred forty five". Shiny, eh? There's one little piece that needs work - 
if the input is a number in the millions, billions, or trillions that contains three zeros between where we 
would place commas, the translator gets a bit confused. Here's an example: 3,000,000,004 would return 
"three billion million thousand four". Other than that, I'm pretty sure I squashed any other possible bugs!
